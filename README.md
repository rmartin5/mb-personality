Myers-Briggs Personality App

This app was meant to be a starting point for pratice in classifying different personalites on-the-go. Much of the processing is meant to be handled from the user, while this is meant to capture and store personalities that can be easily switched between.

Like many projects, this is an ongoing work-in-progress.

### Traits
The main traits depicted in this app are Thinking (Tx), Feeling (Fx), Sensing (Sx), and Intuition (Nx). With each of these categories having an introvert (Xi) and extrovert (Xe) space.

### Styles
Styles are another component in this app to allow for categorizing various approaches to scenarios. These include abstract - concrete, affiliative - pragmatic, interest - systematic, direct - informative, initiating - responding, control - movement. Each of these can be grouped by their opposing style. Dependent on the input we can also group these styles to create a style type to match the given input.
